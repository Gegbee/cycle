	king |-| Today, Ainsley Fishman...
	king |-| You are being exiled.
	player |-| glob.
	king |-| By unicycle.
	player |-| ...
	king |-| You will find that we have glued you to the seat.
	king |-|Once we shove you into the depths
	king |-|Your only chance at freedom is climbing up a perilous cave
	king |-|To remain fair, 
	king |-|We shall give you our reasoning for this punishment.
	king |-|Third degree murder,
	king |-|Possession of alcohol,
	king |-|And assault of officer.
	king |-| Goodbye, Ainsley
	king |-|Now go.

	scroll1 |-| I will leave notes along my journey:
scroll1 |-| My name is Benson Benedict
scroll1 |-| I was a shopkeeper in the sewer society... 
scroll1 |-| well...
scroll1 |-| Until I was charged for murder.
scroll1 |-| A charge for a murder I did not commit.
scroll1 |-| Why King Cod would want me exiled?
scroll1 |-| I am not sure.
scroll1 |-| But nevertheless,
scroll1 |-| He has fooled me!
scroll1 |-| He has exiled me on a conviction I did not commit.
scroll1 |-| Though it is easier for me to adapt to the punishment...
scroll1 |-| ...rather than seek justice.
scroll1 |-| The climb up seems intense,
scroll1 |-| But I am surely not the first to attempt it.

	scroll2 |-| Today I ponder what my purpose is
	scroll2 |-| I scale this well with all my failed friends around me
	scroll2 |-| Yet I find that I do it with ease
	scroll2 |-| Whether this should concern me-
	scroll2 |-| I’m not sure
	scroll2 |-| Though it most definitely makes me feel powerful
	scroll2 |-| Nothing like being exiled into a pit just to enjoy it
	scroll2 |-| I shall see whoever reads this at the top

	scroll3 |-| These statues must have been made during King Salmon’s rule
	scroll3 |-| Each head belongs to a great figure
	scroll3 |-| Both the old and the wise
	scroll3 |-| I wonder if my head would be here if Salmon still ruled 
	scroll3 |-| After all...
	scroll3 |-| I’ve made it so much farther than all the other criminals
	scroll3 |-| I am probably the greatest to ever climb this well
	scroll3 |-| I can't even see the end
	scroll3 |-| If I keep going...
	scroll3 |-| I will undoubtedly achieve centuries of communal effort...
	scroll3 |-| ...in just a little stroll.
